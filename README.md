# Portable socket multimedia-metadata service

Portable socket multimedia-metadata service (or PSMMS for short) is a set of programs and standards of getting metadata about currently playing multimedia from native OS APIs to programs. It is also my UNI project

This allows programs (or websites and by extend OBS overlays) use info about currently playing songs without utilising custom APIs of music providers.
